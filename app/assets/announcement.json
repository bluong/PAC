So here is the first announcement for this thing.  Hopefully you can see the image of Michiko to Hatchin above and hopefully you can click on it and see a few things.
If so, nice.  If not, welp.  I think after taking a glance you can see what I'm trying to do with this.  All the stuff to the right essentially does not work, but they should be up and running within the next few days.
So as shown above, this week's showing is the first 6 episodes of Michiko to Hatchin showing at Rainbow Road as per usual!
